/*
 * Keyboard.
 *
 * There is no ESC key on a Color Computer, so BREAK is the back-out key -- the
 * same choice fujinet-config, fujinet-fujirkle and the calendar client all
 * made, and what the footer spells as BRK. CLEAR joins R as refresh, mirroring
 * the Atari's use of its own CLEAR.
 *
 * The Atari's ESC does double duty: back out of the reader, and quit from the
 * inbox. Splitting those is not a concession, it is an improvement -- BREAK
 * backs out and Q quits, so the key that leaves the program is never one
 * keystroke away from the key that leaves a message. BREAK is simply inert in
 * the inbox, which is what main.c's switch already does with an unhandled code.
